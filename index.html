<h3> AVOCADOS </h3>
<p>Hello everyone, thank you so much for checking out my blog.  I’ve got lots to say and it was a tough decision to decide where to begin.  As this blog is going to be an every growing page of my life, my thoughts, things I love, things that I care about, what better way to begin than with something that is very dear to my heart…..Avocado’s!
Yes, those green things that some people are scared about and not really sure when it’s right to cut one in half.  Those things that Jamie Oliver and any trendy chef has been banging on about for years, and had us pimping out our salads, toast, eggs, Shakshuka’s with.
</p>

<p>
I’m a bit of a late starter when it comes to understanding the greatness of the green beast that is the Avocado.  The ripening process messed with my brain, and I expected that as soon as I shop bought this apparently tasty vegetable (or is it a fruit ?!?) that it would be that gorgeous soft deliciousness that everyone was raving on about.  But no, not me.  For me the Avocado was a hard, solid green thing that was difficult to get into, and wasn’t quite as smooth and velvety as it looks when Jamie gets his mits all over it.   I gave up on it, until…(queue heavenly angel sounds), one day everything became clear.  My awkwardness was no more, I found my Avocado Sixth Sense, and a new love story began…. </p>

<p>Now (you see), the supermarkets make it easy for us.  You can buy the ripened, nearly ripened and loose Avocados from the fresh produce aisle.  Although it doesn’t stop THOSE people (you know who you are) from squeezing the life out of every single Avocado on the shelf until they find the perfect one for them.  SQUEEZE “hmmmm too hard” (picks up another one) SQUEEZE “hmmm  hmmm too soft”.  It’s a good job we don’t have to eat the outside shell because one Avocado must have on average 20 people’s sweaty (un-sanitised) hands all over it.  In fact, supermarkets should provide sanitiser around areas around where food can get man handled by passers-by.  There’s a reason why we don’t eat the free peanuts from a bar you know……
I must confess that I could eat avocados every single day for breakfast, lunch and dinner (and every snacking opportunity in between).  I own two avocado featured t-shirts and an Avocado Cook book that features “50 mouth-watering recipe’s inspired by the world’s favourite fruit”.  Whenever I’m feeling blue, had a tough day or just need a hug on a plate, avocado on toast is my go to food.</p>

<p>Everyone has their own take on how they like their food put together.  With Avocados, some prefer to mash the avocado first perhaps with added sliced plum tomatoes for that additional freshness, or some just slice the Avocado and add with a bit of pepper on top.  Also the bread is a very important part, none of that standard family white medium sliced bread….oh no my friends, it has to be a speciality bread that is sliced rustically and toasted, or for me I like a seeded granary bread.
In fact I will be more than happy to describe in detail my favourite perfect avocado on toast, and try not to salivate over my laptop while I am describing this.
You will need the following:
1.	Granary Seeded Bread.  Hovis or Tesco’s own is pretty damn good too.
2.	1 Avocado ripe
3.	Marmite spread
4.	Butter/Margarine (I use Pure spread)
5.	Black Pepper
When the bread is toasted, use your chosen butter/margarine and spread on a thin layer onto the toast.  Then spread a layer (medium full coverage) of Marmite on the toast.  Place even slices of avocado (overlapped so you can get more on) onto your bread and sprinkle some black pepper on top to finish.  
Voila!  Perfecto…try not to bite your fingers while gorging on your food.  All of this talk has made me hungry so I’m going to head to the kitchen.
Thanks for reading….

<p>Until next time</p>
